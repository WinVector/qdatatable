[`qdatatable`](https://github.com/WinVector/qdatatable) is an implementation of the [`rquery`](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery) piped relational algebra hosted on [`data.tabl`](http://r-datatable.com). `qdatatabl` allow the expression of complex transformations as a series of relational operators. For example scoring a logistic regression model (which requires grouping, ordering, and ranking) is organized as follows. For more on this example please see ["Letâ€™s Have Some Sympathy For The Part-time R User"](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2017/08/lets-have-some-sympathy-for-the-part-time-r-user/).

``` r

    ## Loading required package: rquery

    ## Loading required package: wrapr

``` r
library("data.table")
```

    ## Attaching package: 'data.table'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:wrapr':

Initial benchmarking of `qdatatable` is very favorable (notes [here](https://github.com/WinVector/rquery/blob/master/extras/data_table.md)).

To install `qdatatable` please use `devtools` as follows.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("WinVector/qdatatable")
```
