title: "Timing Grouped Mean"

This note is a comment on some of the timings shared in the dplyr-0.8.0 [pre-release announcement](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/12/dplyr-0-8-0-release-candidate/).

The original published timings were as follows:

[![](timings_summarise_mean_dplyr-0-8-0.jpg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/12/dplyr-0-8-0-release-candidate/)

With performance metrics: measurements are marketing.  So let's dig in the above a bit.

These timings are be of [small task large number of repetition breed](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-benchmarking.html#avoid-microbenchmark...-times100) that  Matt Dowle writes against.  So they at first wouldn't seem that decisive. Except, look at the following:

  * At the time of our reading the example and methods were not shared. To reproduce the work we will need to make our own example (which we share [here](https://github.com/WinVector/rqdatatable/blob/master/extras/TimingGroupedMean.Rmd)).
  * The timings are not relative to any other package or system (base-`R`, `data.table`, and `Pandas` being three obvious choices), so may have trouble valuing the results.
  * The time reported for `dplyr` on the `sum()/n()` examples is over a second to process 10,000 rows.  This is unbelievably slow, and we fail to reproduce it in our run.
  * The time reported for `dplyr` on the `mean()` examples is about 0.01 seconds.  This is a plausible time for this task (about 3 times as long as `data.table` would take). But it is much faster than is typical for `dplyr`.  We fail to reproduce it in our run, we see `dplyr` taking closer to 0.07 seconds on this task (or about seven times slower).

Let's try to reproduce these timings on a 2018 Dell XPS 13 Intel Core i5, 16GB Ram running Ubuntu 18.04, and also compare to some other packages: [`data.table`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table) and [`rqdatatable`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rqdatatable).

In this reproduction attempt we see:

  * The `dplyr` time being around 0.05 seconds.  This is about 5 times slower than claimed.
  * The `dplyr` `sum()/n()` time is about 0.2 seconds, about 5 times faster than claimed.
  * The `data.table` time being around 0.003 seconds.  This is about three times as fast as the `dplyr` claims, and over ten times as fast as the actual observed `dplyr` behavior.


All code for this benchmark is available [here](https://github.com/WinVector/rqdatatable/blob/master/extras/TimingGroupedMean.Rmd) and [here](https://github.com/WinVector/rqdatatable/blob/master/extras/TimingGroupedMean.md).
